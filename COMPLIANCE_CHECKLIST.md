## üîß FINAL ACTION ITEMS

1. **‚úÖ Run the compliance test suite**: `node health-check.js` - COMPLETED (4/5 endpoints healthy)
2. **üöÄ Deploy to production**: Follow the deployment workflow below
3. **Verify recommendation data accuracy** - Ensure no falsified product data
4. **Final UI testing** - Manual check of all admin interface components
5. **Review API scopes** - Ensure only necessary permissions requested

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### Recommended Order (CRITICAL):
1. **First: Deploy to Render** üåê
   - Render hosts your app code at `https://jarvis2-0-djg1.onrender.com`
   - All webhooks and APIs must be live before Shopify deploy
   
2. **Then: Run Shopify Deploy** üì°
   ```powershell
   shopify app deploy
   ```
   - Updates app configuration in Shopify Partners
   - Registers webhooks with live Render URLs
   - Applies scope changes and OAuth settings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
- **Render = App Code Hosting** (your actual application)
- **Shopify Deploy = Configuration Sync** (settings, webhooks, scopes)
- **Always deploy to Render first** - Shopify needs live URLs to register webhooks

## üìã TESTING CHECKLIST

- [ ] Run automated compliance tests (`node health-check.js`)
- [ ] Test app installation flow
- ‚úÖ Test app uninstallation and cleanup - **FIXED: Webhook now handles cleanup properly**
