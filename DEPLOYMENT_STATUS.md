# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS - Ready for Production

## ✅ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

- **Status**: ✅ Build now completes successfully
- **Verification**: `npm run build` runs without errors

### 🔄 **Uninstall Webhook Fixed** 
- **Issue**: `TokenCleanupService is not defined` causing 500 errors
- **Solution**: Removed dependency, implemented standard cleanup
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and includes version tracking
